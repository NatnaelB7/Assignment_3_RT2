# Assignment 3: Statistics
For the third assignment of Research Track II, we were tasked with conducting a statistical analysis on the first assignment of Research Track I. The objective was to compare the performance of two distinct algorithms, one developed by a colleague and the other by myself. The analysis focused on evaluating their effectiveness in locating silver and golden tokens within the environment, while considering the random placement of these tokens.

The aim was to determine which implementation yielded better results through rigorous statistical examination. By comparing the two approaches and their respective outcomes, we sought to ascertain the extent to which each implementation excelled in successfully identifying and retrieving the tokens of interest.

Overall, the objective of this assignment was to conduct a professional and methodical statistical assessment, enabling us to make informed judgments about the relative effectiveness of the two algorithms in completing the task at the given environment.
